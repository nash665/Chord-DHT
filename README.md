Chord-DHT
=========

This is an academic project to develop a Distributed Hash Table based on the Chord system. The platform used to build the system is Android. Multiple emulators are used to mimic the behavior of a distributed system. The main aim of this project is to provide three features : 

   1. ID Space partitioning/re-partitioning
   2. Ring-based routing
   3. Concurrent Node Joins
   
This initial version does not, however, provide the implementation for finger-based routing. It also cannot handle node leaves or failures.
